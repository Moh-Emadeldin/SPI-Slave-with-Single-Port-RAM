# SPI Slave with Single Port RAM

## Overview

This project implements an SPI Slave module with a Single Port RAM in Verilog. The design is structured into two main modules:

+ Single Port RAM Module: Handles data storage and retrieval.

+ SPI Slave Module: Manages SPI communication and interacts with RAM.

 + Top Module: Integrates both modules to form a complete system.

The functionality is thoroughly tested using multiple testbenches, and the design is synthesized and implemented using Xilinx Vivado.

# Features

+ Fully functional SPI Slave that interfaces with an external SPI Master.

+ Single Port RAM for efficient data storage.

+ Testbenches for both the SPI Slave and the RAM module to ensure correctness.

+ Automated simulation using a do file for streamlined verification.

+ Vivado Synthesis & Implementation to validate hardware feasibility
